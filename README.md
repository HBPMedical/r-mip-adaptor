# r-mip-adaptor R package

This package provides helper functions to connect to a database via JDBC.

The functions follow the runtime environment defined by Woken and simplify the packaging of a R script into a Docker image to be used by [woken](https://github.com/LREN-CHUV/woken).

We follow the [coding standards](https://cran.r-project.org/manuals.html#R-exts) defined by R-CRAN
